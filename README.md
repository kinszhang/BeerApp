Description:
This is Wei Zhang's Technical Challenge Solution --- Wei's Awesome Beer App;
This app is developed based on ReactJs and Redux. The Boilerplate I used is `create-react-app`.
Youâ€™ll need to have `Node >= 6` on your local development machine to run this App.

Instruction:
To Run the App, firstly run command `npm install`, then run `npm start`.
Then open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser, now you will see the App.
You can click the `Check out a random beer` button to get a random beer.
Also, you can click the `Brewery name` which has highlighted in `Red` to view more details about the brewery.
In the Brewery page, you can click "Try another beer (Go Back)" button to back to the previous page.

To Run the Unit Test, please run this command `npm test` and you will see the test result.
